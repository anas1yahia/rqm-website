      <!-- In the design, the form is on the left (RTL) or right? 
           Based on design node 5670:1012, it looks like just the form is prominent.
           Wait, looking at 5670:1009, there is a big title "Contact Us" and then the form container.
           The info cards are BELOW the form in 5670:1141 context within the full page?
           Let's re-check the design structure from the context provided.
           Context for 5670:1009 says: "Container" -> "ContactPageFuturistic" -> ...
           It seems the page has the Title, then a horizontal flex container (Form + something else?).
           Actually, the form component context 5670:1013 is inside 5670:1011 which is "Form".
           And the Info component 5670:1141 is a row of 4 cards.
           
           Let's stack them: Title -> Form -> Info Cards -> Footer.
